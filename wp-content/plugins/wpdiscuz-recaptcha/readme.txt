Best protection for your comments with wpDiscuz Google reCAPTCHA addon!
The new (2.0) reCAPTCHA is great. A significant number of your users can 
now attest they are human without having to solve a CAPTCHA. Instead with 
just a single click theyâ€™ll confirm they are not a robot. People call it 
the No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA experience.  This addon protects your website 
comments from spam and abuse while letting real people pass through with ease.
