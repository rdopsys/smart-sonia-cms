== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/wp-better-permalinks` directory, or install plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate plugin through `Plugins` screen in WordPress Admin Panel.
3. Use `Settings -> WP Better Permalinks` screen to configure the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the plugin work? =

To start with, you should add Custom Post Types and Taxonomies assigned to them. Without this, the plugin will not work because it creates a friendly link structure of Custom Post Type and Taxonomy.

Then on the plugin settings page you can choose Taxonomy for each Custom Post Type that will be preferred for building URLs.

You can create your own Custom Post Types and Taxonomies using the built-in functions in WordPres or additional plugins.

Finally, just save the plugin settings and the new structure for links will work.

= How do I register Custom Post Type and Taxonomy to set up permalink structure for them? =

You can use the Wordpress features: [register_post_type](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type) and [register_taxonomy](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_taxonomy) or use any plugin for this. It is important to set visibility as `public` in arguments.

= Does the plugin modify Custom Post Type and Taxonomy settings? =

Yes. Minor corrections are made to allow the plugin to work properly.

In the case of Custom Post Type, the value of `hierarchical` is set to `false`. If set to `true`, the parent post servant is displayed in the link. The child post may have a different category, which would cause URL mismatch.

For Taxonomy, set the `hierarchical` value in the `rewrite` section for hierarchical terms. Thanks to this, we keep the tree structure, which is very important.

= Can I choose one Taxonomy for several Custom Post Types? =

Unfortunately not. This possibility is not available. You can assign Taxonomy to only one Custom Post Type.

Adding one Taxonomy to many Custom Post Types settings will not be saved.

= How are links created? =

Links are created according to the structure:
* Custom Post Type > Single Term *(or Term tree)* > Post
* Custom Post Type > Post *(when no term is selected)*
* Custom Post Type > Single Term *(or Term tree)*

If you choose more than one category for a post, the first one is always taken.

= Is the plugin completely free? =

Yes. The plugin is completely free.

However, working on plugins and technical support requires many hours of work. If you want to appreciate it, you can [provide us a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/gbiorczyk/?utm_source=wp-better-permalinks&utm_medium=readme-faq). Thanks everyone!
