Easily send a simple custom email with an attachment from the WordPress administration screen.

== Description ==

Send Email From Admin gives you the ability to easily send a custom HTML email from the WordPress administration screen. You can send to existing users or add your own recipients. You can send to multiple recipients and choose to send group emails or individual emails. Emails can also have an attachment. A new menu item called 'Send Email' is added under the Tools menu. This plugin is also translatable.

NOTE: This is not intended to be a mass/bulk mailing plugin. This is a very lean plugin that is best suited to send an email to one or up to a handful of recipients. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload `send-email-from-admin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the From name and From email address? =
